# About the Krusty Krab

## Our History

The Krusty Krab was founded by Eugene H. Krabs in 1999. Once a naval officer with a passion for cooking, Mr. Krabs transformed an abandoned retirement home called the "Rusty Krab" into what is now Bikini Bottom's most successful restaurant.

The establishment rose to fame when Mr. Krabs developed the secret recipe for the Krabby Patty, a delicacy so delicious that it has become the talk of the entire ocean. The recipe remains locked in Mr. Krabs' safe, protected from competitors (especially Plankton from the Chum Bucket across the street).

## Our Team

### Eugene H. Krabs - Owner & Founder
Mr. Krabs is the visionary entrepreneur behind the Krusty Krab. With his keen business sense and love for money, he has built the restaurant into a thriving enterprise. Despite his thrifty nature, Mr. Krabs ensures quality is never compromised when it comes to the Krabby Patty.

### SpongeBob SquarePants - Head Fry Cook
SpongeBob joined the Krusty Krab team after demonstrating extraordinary spatula skills during a sudden customer rush. His enthusiasm for Krabby Patty craftsmanship is unmatched, and he takes tremendous pride in his role as the primary creator of our signature dish. SpongeBob holds the record for most Employee of the Month awards in Bikini Bottom history.

### Squidward Tentacles - Cashier
Squidward handles customer service at the front register. While known for his unique approach to customer relations, Squidward is a talented clarinet player and aspiring artist who brings culture and sophistication to our establishment. He has been with the Krusty Krab for many years and is an integral part of our team.

## Our Philosophy

4. Supporting our local economy by employing Bikini Bottom residents

## Our Restaurant

The Krusty Krab's distinctive building was originally a lobster trap used on the surface. It features our iconic wooden exterior with porthole windows, a ship's wheel entrance door, and flags flying proudly on top. Inside, customers enjoy our nautical-themed dining area with wooden tables and the famous order window where SpongeBob delivers freshly made Krabby Patties.

Our kitchen is equipped with state-of-the-art grill technology, allowing for the perfect preparation of each Krabby Patty. The restaurant also features Mr. Krabs' office, where the business magic happens and the secret formula is securely stored.
